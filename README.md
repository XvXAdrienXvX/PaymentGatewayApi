# Payment Gateway API

Payment Gateway API built with ASP.NET Core 2.2 to process payments for merchants

## Frameworks and Libraries
- [ASP.NET Core 2.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) (for data access)
- [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) (for mapping resources and models)
- [xUnit Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test)(Unit Test)
- [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/)(Application Logging)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2017?view=sql-server-ver15)(Data Storage)
- [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle) (API documentation)

## Functionalities
- Merchant can process payment (POST) through the api
- Merchant can get details of a specific payment (GET)
- Bank client & ValidatePayment to simulate/mock bank processing flow

## Database Schema

## Assumptions
- Payments have a status
  ```
  Pending: 1,
  Approved: 2
  ```
  
- The acquiring bank is a client connecting to the gateway endpoint. To simulate/mock the bank, a console app is created in folder Bank which uses
  HttpClient to Get All Payments & check for pending payments. 
  
- ValidatePayment class & CardDetailsValidator class simulate some of the validations performed through the server. The status of payments is updated from Pending to Approve

- A succesfull payment has an approved status

## How to Test
First, install [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). Then, open the terminal or command prompt at the API root path (```/src/PaymentGatewayApi/```) 
and run the following command:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Navigate to ```https://localhost:5001/api/payment/GetAllPayments```

Navigate to ```https://localhost:5001/index.html``` to check the API documentation.

To test endpoints, you'll need to use a software such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

```
sample test data for POST Request

{
   "MerchantID": 1,
   "CurrencyId": 1,
   "CardDetailsId": 1,
   "OrderID": 1,
   "Amount": 1000,
   "Status": 1,
   "ProcessedDate":"2020-08-07",
   "Currency": {
      "Name": "US Dollars",
      "Code": 1
   },
   "CardDetails":{
       "CustomerID": 1,
       "CardType": {
           "CardTypeId": 1,
           "Name": "VISA"
       },
       "CardNumber": "4424007114223158",
       "Cvv": 123,
       "ExpiryDate": "2025-03-29"
   }
}
```

## Running Bank HttpClient
1. Open solution in visual studio, run server PaymentGatewayApi

2. Open another instance of the solution in visual studio 
   Point Startup Projects towards Bank and run the console app

## Unit Test
xUnit is used to test the PaymentController
```
Test Data is stored in a json file (PaymentGatewayTest/PaymentTestData.json)
The file is diserialized to a list of payments initialised in the contructor of the Fake service (PaymentServiceFake)
```
